/* 
 * Here we declare variables that are going to be saved. 
 * 
 * To save data in the game, we need to save the following:
 * - Player's current level, current EXP, current amount of money and amount of EXP to level up
 * - Which traps are unlocked
 * - Weapon damage level, reload speed, ammo size, and fire rate.
 * - Level highscores
 * 
 * When the player reloads the game, they start out in the space ship, which occurs when they boot up the app.
